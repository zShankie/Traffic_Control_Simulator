# Traffic Control Simulator 🚦

A basic GUI-based Traffic Control Simulator built using Python's `tkinter`. This program mimics a traffic scenario with roads, vehicles, and traffic signals that change colors to simulate traffic control. Vehicles move accordingly, providing a simple animated representation of how a traffic system works.
